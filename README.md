# RBXRequests
An HTTP requests module for Roblox designed with control and flexibility in mind. 

## Documentation
Module documentation [**here**](https://github.com/astriaInight/RBXRequests/blob/main/documentation.md)

## Features
### 1. Cookies
RBXRequests supports setting cookies for each request, opening up many possibilities, such as ranking Roblox users in a group, interacting with a Roblox account, or signing into many other services.

### 2. Headers
Though, the built-in HTTPService already supports setting headers, this module is designed to make the experience even more intuitive.

### 3. Ease of use
Most functions in this module include a single, simple dictionary as a parameter for requests. This dictionary should include a URL, headers (optional), and cookies, (optional).

### 4. Access roblox.com links
Thanks to the help of [rprxy](https://github.com/sentanos/rprxy) by [sentanos](https://github.com/sentanos), we have been able to easily bypass some of the restrictions of [HttpService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/HttpService)
